### The Problem
While this Data is great for summarization. It is unfortunatly is not in a computer readable format. (Like a .CSV, .PY, .JS file or a stamdard Column structure) Before we can even begin our analysis,  we to need clean our data and transform it into a computer readable format. While the Data itself isn't Dirty. Only the architecture/format of the data is messy. 


#### Fix Data Structure
We apply a re-format to transform the table into column structure. We add the products, into a product column.

### Applying Calculations for $ amount (exisitng and new customers)
#### (% of Existing/New customers / Revenue = $ of Existing/New customers)

### Applying Calculations and identify Market penetration. Using Formula v1-v2/v2*100  
#### (= Revenue - Total addressable Market/ Total Addressable Market * 100)

Now that the structural format is fixed, and some calculations perofrmed. We can upload our Data to Tableau.

### Now that we Have our Data analysed. We Create a Slide deck, and present it to Jons team.

## TLDR of Slide Deck
* Widget is our fastest growing product With the highest User increase this year.
* Data Cruncher is our fastest growing revenue product this year.
* Sales RVP needs to set quotas on a number of Products. Otherwise, will not meet revenue goals. 
* Based on our data, We identified anticipated attrition of existing customers, we must work with CSG to target which products are going to attrition.
* we can upsell our 3 highest rated productscertain products. Jack recommends we sell while users are using the widget app because this is where all our new users.
* 3 month free promotion. We should promote a free 3 month promotion, for 1 year of subscription. Jack has calculated how much additional revenue this would make, on avearge Per product.
