### Problem
While this Data is great for summarization. It is unfortunatly is not in a computer readable format. (Like a .CSV, .PY, .JS file or a stamdard Column structure) Before we can even begin our analysis,  we to need clean our data and transform it into a computer readable format. While the Data itself isn't Dirty. Only the architecture/format of the data is messy. 


### Fix Data Structure
We apply a re-format to transform the table into column structure. We add the products, into a product column.

### Applying Calculations for $ amount (exisitng and new customers)
#### (% of Existing/New customers / Revenue = $ of Existing/New customers)

### Applying Calculations and identify Market penetration. Using Formula v1-v2/v2*100  
#### (= Revenue - Total addressable Market/ Total Addressable Market * 100)

Now that the structural format is fixed, and some calculations perofrmed. We can upload our Data to Tableau.
